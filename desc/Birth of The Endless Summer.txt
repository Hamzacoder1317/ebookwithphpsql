An impassioned voyage to destinations worldwide   ̶  including Teahupo’o in Tahiti, Pipeline at Oahu’s North Shore, Tavarua in Fiji, and Cape St. Francis in South Africa  ̶  Birth of The Endless Summer: A Surf Odyssey features the highs and lows of taking to the ocean. With reflections from surf pioneer Dick Metz and pro-surfers Rob Machado, Kassia Meador, Strider “Raspberry” Wasilewski, Nathan Fletcher, and Derek Hynd, to name a few, this is an odyssey that everyone can revel in.


Featuring a foreword from award-winning director Richard Yelland, whose documentary Birth of The Endless Summer pays homage to Bruce Brown’s historic film The Endless Summer and focuses on Dick Metz as he vagabonds around the world between 1958 and 1961  ̶  a trip that would ultimately lead to his discovery of the renowned “perfect wave” at Cape St. Francis  ̶ this Scribd Original companion book, just like both films, continues the “dream adventure that allows you to write your own ending.”


Each story in Birth of The Endless Summer: A Surf Odyssey is an eye-opening, exhilarating account of a surfer’s deep connection to the beauty   ̶  and danger   ̶  of the ocean’s waves and the road less traveled to get to them, as well as the impact Brown’s beloved The Endless Summer had on defining epic surf and travel culture for generations to come.
